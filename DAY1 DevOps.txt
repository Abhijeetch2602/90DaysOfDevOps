what is SDLC?
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is the software development world’s spellcheck. It can flag errors in software creation before they’re discovered in successive stages — and would cost a lot more to fix. But it’s much more than that: SDLC can also lay out a plan for getting everything right the first time.
The SDLC process involves several distinct stages, including planning, analysis, design, building, testing, deployment and maintenance. 
Since DevOps involves various stages/ phases:

Source Code Management
Continuous Integration
Continuous Testing
Configuration Management
Contanerization
Continuous Monitoring
